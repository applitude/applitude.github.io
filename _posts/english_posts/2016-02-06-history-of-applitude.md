title: The history of Applitude
---

Applitude was established during the autumn of 2015 by a group of students from the Department of Informatics located at
the University of Oslo. The group of students decided to create a social community for students with a interest in developing apps. The statutes was signed by the founding members the 12th of October 2015, making Applitude officially a student organization!

The first events we had was a introduction course for iOS and Android development with more than 30 people who participated. Since the establishment of Applitude we've had our weekly «app evenings» where we learn and make apps for Android and iOS. The first year we had over 20 events on one semester, making us definitely one of the most active student organizations in the Department of Informatics.

The <span>29th</span> january 2016 we went on our first company visit ([link in norwegian](bedriftsbesok-til-shortcut.html)). This time to the app development company shortcut! We had a small «interview» where we asked generally about app development, both technical and non-technical.

Applitude is the first and only student organization in the University of Oslo that is devoted to learning about and developing mobile applications. We now have more that 20 members and the number in increasing.
